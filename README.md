# Fivesnight
**Fivesnight** is a simple Discord bot used to facilitate LoL 5v5s for me and my "friends."

## Usage
- From within the 5v5 server[^1], type `/teams` to begin a new virtual queue
- Click "Check Queue" to make sure everyone is ready, then click "Create Teams"
- Create custom game from within the League client

That's it for now. Dead simple bot.
